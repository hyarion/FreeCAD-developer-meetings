# FreeCAD Developer Meeting

**Sunday, 6 October 2024**

1. **Volunteer to take minutes**
2. **1.0 release status**
3. (sliptonic) Reports that getting Openfoam and CFD workbench working on FreeCAD (Mac) is too difficult.  We have requests from educators wanting to do this.  What can be done to make this easier?
4. (hyarion) Splashscreen - Talks are that it will be redesigned after 1.0. Minor changes has caused major platform dependent issues in the past and we need to avoid that going forward. Where should these discussion take place and how do we ensure that the new solution works on all platforms?
5. (hyarion) Translations - I've seen many crowdin changes (across multiple languages) that haven't been marked as accepted. These changes aren't synced. Can we improve the process? Should we have maintainers for translations?
6. (hyarion) Measure - There's been a bug Whac-A-Mole lately. How can we ensure the messure tool is stable enough for 1.0?
7. (hyarion) Exception handling (macOS) - FreeCAD crashes on macOS when event handlers fail to catch all exceptions. [Here's the issue](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/16905), whatâ€™s the best approach to address this?
